To run once:

GOPATH=`pwd`/../../ go run scale.go eye.ppm out.ppm 2

To run 2000 times:

date; { for i in {1..2000}; do GOPATH=`pwd`/../../ go run scale.go eye.ppm out.ppm 2; done } | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'; date


Reliabilities: 0.999 try, 0.9999 catch

Result with recovery over 2000 runs: 11 failures (~8 mins test time)
