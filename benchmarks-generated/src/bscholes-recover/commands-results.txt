To run once:

GOPATH=`pwd`/../../ go run bscholes.go

To run 2000 times:

date; { for i in {1..2000}; do GOPATH=`pwd`/../../ go run bscholes.go; done } | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'; date

To run 2000 times and record L2 diff:

date; { for i in {1..2000}; do GOPATH=`pwd`/../../ go run bscholes.go; done } | awk '{if($1){print $2;s+=$2;n++}} END {if(n > 0)print s/n}'; date


Reliabilities: 0.999 try, 0.9999 catch

Result with recovery over 2000 runs: 3 failures (~ 7 mins test time)
